# R.GEN - Number Guessing game

## Overview
This is a simple number guessing game built using Jetpack Compose for Android. The game challenges the player to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range and within a limited number of attempts.

## Features
- **Customizable Ranges**: Players can set their own lower and upper limits for the random number.
- **Limited Attempts**: Players are given a fixed number of attempts to guess the correct number.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Feedback is provided after each guess, indicating whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
- **Game Over Screen**: Players are informed when they have won or lost and can choose to play again.
